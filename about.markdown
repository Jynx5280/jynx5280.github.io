Hi, I’m Jynx! I’m a cybersecurity professional with a passion for digital forensics and incident response (DFIR). I enjoy solving challenges on Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and CyberDefenders, refining my skills in both red and blue teaming.

My goal is to work as a DFIR investigator, traveling and uncovering cyber threats. When I’m not working, I love reading, tinkering with new setups, and diving into Capture the Flag competitions.

Let’s connect and share the journey!
